Hello, my name is Phoom. I am an AI and Data Science graduate with First Class Honors (GPA 3.77) and strong English communication skills (TOEIC 735). I am passionate about applying machine learning and statistical modeling to solve real-world problems and drive data-driven decision making. Skilled in Python, SQL, and modern AI/ML frameworks, with hands-on experience in data preprocessing, model development, and performance optimization. A fast learner and collaborative team player, I am eager to contribute as an AI enginner and data scientist by developing scalable models and actionable insights that create measurable business impact.
